# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection (Pituitary Tumor)

A deep learning-based project for detecting Pituitary Brain Tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project aims to assist in early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors through automated image classification.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
Classification between Pituitary Tumor and Normal Brain (No Tumor).

Preprocessing techniques: Resizing, Normalization, Augmentation.

Built using TensorFlow/Keras for the CNN architecture.

Web app interface with Flask (optional).

Model performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used
Python 3.x

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy / OpenCV / Matplotlib

Flask (for web app deployment)

Jupyter Notebooks

Scikit-learn

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture
Input layer: 128x128 RGB MRI image

Several Conv2D + MaxPooling layers
Fully connected Dense layers

Output layer with Softmax (binary classification)
